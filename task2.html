                                    We’ve all encountered websites and applications that make us want to throw our
                                    devices
                                    across the room in frustration.
                                    At least, I hope it’s not just me. Fundamentally, a good user interface enables
                                    users to
                                    complete the task that they came to the website to do with ease and without
                                    cofusion.Truly
                                    great UI designers achieve
                                    this and more. Really exceptional user interfaces will not just please the user by
                                    facilitating the frictionless
                                    achievement of the task at hand—they will also please them aesthetically and
                                    experientially.And that could mean any
                                    number of things: a slick, original animated interaction that intuitively draws the
                                    user’s
                                    attention to a certain element,
                                    or an uncluttered, clean design and clever use of white space that imbues the user
                                    with a
                                    sense of calm, for example.In this
                                    article, I’ll tackle the question of what makes a good user interface—with a bit of
                                    help
                                    from the Nielsen Norman Group—before
                                    diving into eight examples of great website UI design, and a substantiation of my
                                    choice.
                                    Select an example from the clickable
                                    menu to jump straight to it, or simply read on.

                                    So, if you’re wondering how to evaluate whether a user interface is good—<em>
                                        or even great—</em>how do you decide? I mean, you can determine whether you find
                                    a user interface visually appealing,
                                    and you can of course use the interface to ascertain whether it’s an intuitive,
                                    straightforward experience.
                                    <em>But is there anything more objective? More formalized?</em>
                                </p>

                                    should also reflect the personality of the brand in order to stand out from the

                                <p>With Medium, content is king. Once a user is logged in, a box appears at the top of
                                    the article list with the text “Write here”, enabling and encouraging everyone to
                                    get writing quickly. When users click on the “Write a Story” link, they are
                                    presented with an almost empty white page, removing clutter and simply providing a
                                    clean space to focus on writing.</p>
                                <p>Articles are set up in a one column format, making content easy to digest. With
                                    little touches like estimated read time and the ability to highlight and respond
                                    directly to specific pieces of articles, Medium truly provides users with an amazing

                                <p>Bear with me on this one. Just for a moment.</p>
                                <p>When it comes to helping users complete the process of booking a flight, Virgin
                                    America was one of the first – if not <em>the</em> first – to put the user’s
                                    interests front and centre. For most, booking a flight is a chore. Much like a
                                    dishwasher relieves us of having to scrub the dishes, Virgin America’s site stripped
                                    back their interface to draw attention to the most important question: “Where would
                                    you like to go?” By removing all the surrounding content, the user could immediately
                                    start the booking process.</p>
                                <p>And yes, the site might now look a little dated, but it deserves its place on this
                                    list as <a href="https://work.co/virgin-america" rel="noopener">something of a
                                        trailblazer in user-centered interface design</a>. Unfortunately, since merging

                                <p><strong>Back to what made Virgin America’s site great though:</strong> Throughout the
                                    entire process of booking, the user was reminded of their selection by a bar at the
                                    top of the screen showing their current choices. By keeping this information
                                    visible, Virgin made it easy for users to constantly see and edit their choices
                                    instead of relying on them to recall the information themselves. The UI here was
                                    clearly designed to ensure that a user can focus on completing their goal as quickly
                                    and efficiently as possible.</p>

                                <p>Virgin also made sure to stand out visually from the competition. The use of bright
                                    colors, gradients, and fun illustrations created a unique brand personality and
                                    experience that sets them apart from other competitors’ websites.</p>

                                <p>The website UI design of Airbnb does two things very well: booking a place to stay,

                                <p>This conversational invite to start searching is a delightful way of portraying the
                                    voice of the brand, as well as making the process of finding a place to stay simple.
                                    The only fields you need to specify during this initial search are: choosing a

                                <p>The listing pages are complete with a description of any additional fees that may be
                                    included. This is a very straightforward, easy process for just about any user. The
                                    ‘Request to Book’ button sits right under this, and being one of the brightest
                                    buttons on the page, invites users to click it in order to finalize their stay.</p>
                                <p>After a user has requested to book a location, they are taken to a new checkout page.
                                    The listing, pricing and booking information sits to the right of the page to reduce
                                    the need for the guest to retain the information from the previous page.</p>
                                <p>On the left, instead of getting right into the payment, the page prompts you to “say
                                    hello to your host and tell them why you’re coming”. By placing this prior to the
                                    payment information, it starts a conversation and connection between the guest and
                                    host, and further invests the user in the experience. <strong>Airbnb takes pride in
                                        bringing people together and gives the conversation importance over the
                                        transaction – the UI reflects this perfectly.</strong></p>
                                <p>Airbnb has cleverly thought out its copy and used engaging photos and videos to
                                    ensure that the interface conveys an emotional tone that helps create a sense of
                                    trust between strangers.</p>

                                    delivered only the most relevant information: image, top speed, range, price,

                                    Dropbox has one of the most easily understandable interfaces by far. Having a folder
                                    and file organizational structure is easily recognizable to, you know, anyone who’s
                                    ever used a computer before. In terms of learnability, there isn’t much that the
                                    average user won’t already know how to do from the start. It’s natural for most
                                    users to try dragging and dropping files from their desktops to the page without
                                    them even knowing if it’s possible or not, just because it’s so familiar.
                                </p>

                                <p>Dropbox’s friendly personality, created by lighthearted illustrations, helps the user
                                    feel comfortable when using the product. This addition to the interface makes the
                                    product feel like an old friend, ready to help users complete their file sharing
                                    tasks.

                                    And they have – possibly – the best blog design in the world right now. I know, I
                                    know, there’s a healthy dose of subjectivity in a comment like that, but rarely have
                                    I seen such a successful mix of experimental UI, usability and multimedia content in
                                    one place.

                                    There’s so much attention to detail, with sequenced color palettes and animated
                                    icons, and wonderful illustration that is coordinated with all the other wonderful
                                    illustrations – it manages to come across as experimental, creative and consistent.
                                    That’s quite an achievement! Check it out!</p>

                                <h2 id="pitch" class="intext-cta__blog-title">6. Pitch</h2>
                                <p>Pitch, a mobile and web application that helps you to build and manage beautiful
                                    presentations, is very much a design-led technology company. They want to convince
                                    you that they can do for presentations what Slack has done for communications. And
                                    they do a pretty good job of it.

                                    Goodbye Powerpoint, hello Pitch.

                                    As soon as you land on their homepage, you can tell that an enormous amount of
                                    thought has gone into every single element. Just consider the slogan. “All hands on
                                    deck” plays in so many ways; not only is it an instantly recognizable idiom, but it
                                    also evokes both the spirit of collaboration—a central feature of Pitch—and the
                                    technobabble of the “all hands meetings”. Finally, the “deck” is a clever reference
                                    to the presentation deck. A gold star to whomever came up with that!

                                    The UI designers at Pitch’s site do a great job of walking the user through an
                                    example of what their journey would be like if they were actually using the
                                    application. They’ve struck a good balance between clean and comprehensive, avoiding
                                    clutter but ensuring the primary product features are covered, so that the site
                                    itself really gets out of the way.</p>
                                <p><img class="lazy-loaded" title="Example of clean, uncluttered UI design from Pitch"

                                <p>Their site gives a nod to recent design trends with their comprehensive use of
                                    illustration, but it errs away from the kind of flat, cartoonish character design
                                    that you see on so many sites currently. The Pixar-like use of 3D character design
                                    is unusual in this space, and therefore instantly identifiable—if I show you a Pitch
                                    hand tomorrow, you’ll recall the company, guaranteed.

                                    And the merits of their website UI design don’t stop there. They’ve also added some
                                    smart, subtle dynamic elements and animations which bring the site to life and nudge
                                    the user from one scroll to the next. They gently draw your attention from right to
                                    left, and the delayed onset of each animation encourages you to pause at each
                                    product feature and benefit. You’re left with a sense of gentle familiarity, of
                                    playfulness, and of professionalism—making presentations will never be tedious
                                    again!
                                    Cleo, a chat-based mobile application that helps you to organize and manage your
                                    finances, has also taken an intriguing approach to their UI, which may be of
                                    interest to those of you looking to feature real users in your imagery. Their focus
                                    is obviously on the download, but rather than incorporating character design and
                                    animation to display the product’s features, Cleo loops video of the product in
                                    action, along with its resultant satisfied users.

                                    I like this touch, but unfortunately the experience as a whole evokes anxiety, with
                                    the high contrast between the cheap Ryanair-blue and the white, the rushed dynamism
                                    of the animations, and the repetition of the call-to-action buttons at every
                                    opportunity.

                                    The old adage that less is more is so often true with UI. Other apps which have
                                    developed fantastic landing page experiences include Blinkist and Slack. Blinkist,
                                    which is a reading app, has won awards for its product design. And good design is
                                    obviously in the company’s DNA. Just look at the gorgeous color palette below, how
                                    they funnel the user’s attention towards the main call-to-action from their
                                    imperative-driven slogan, and how they place their product at the center of an
                                    ecosystem of a typical millennial’s essential reading products—the self-improvement
                                    books, the Kindle, and the hipster glasses. So much communicated, so efficiently.

                                <p>Frank and Oak, a clothing retailer with a strong media and lifestyle focus, uses
                                    their UI to grab the attention of their users and their taste of style. While it is

                                    personality of the brand and their target audience. Despite some bold, sales-driven
                                    marketing messaging—20% off sitewide—their brand image is firmly stamped from the
                                    very first touchpoint with the company. Cool, clean, up close and personal.</p>

                                <p>After clicking on an item, the product page is focused on two things: the product
                                    photography, and the call to action button as they are essentially the only colored
                                    elements on the page. With a nice touch, the ‘Add to Cart’ button won’t work until a
                                    size is selected. When a user tries to click the button first, the color is
                                    desaturated and the text switches to ‘Select Your Size’.</p>

                                <p>Filling out personal information during the checkout process for the first time is
                                    never an ideal experience. It’s unavoidably a clunky process – or, at least, no one
                                    has figured out how to make it smooth for first time buyers. Frank and Oak do a good
                                    job though – they help users out by breaking the form into smaller chunks of input
                                    fields to reduce the cognitive load on users. And yes, it’s clean and uncluttered.

                                    By now you will have learned that those are some of my most important criteria for
                                    good user interface design!</p>

                                <p>In all, a lot of the underlying UI—and certainly the UX—of Frank and Oak can be seen
                                    on many other websites, but it’s the way they have interwoven a very logical,
                                    intuitive user journey, a bold, impactful and clean UI, and a tight, aspirational
                                    brand image and messaging that really makes this stand out.

                                    I guess that’s the lesson from the seventh site on the list: good UI can only be
                                    great if it arrives hand-in-hand with good UX and well-researched, confident
                                    messaging.

                                    Oh, and did I mention they also have an awesome blog – or magazine? They’re clearly
                                    well and truly versed in the art of building out a media and lifestyle arm of a
                                    company, going so far as to build out a newspaper-style magazine that harks back to
                                    newsstand newspaper formats, yet juxtaposed with modern, bold, cut-and-paste
                                    imagery. Love it!</p>

                                <p>If you’re interested in becoming a qualified UI designer, I recommend taking a
                                    structured <a
                                        href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ui-design/best-ui-design-courses/">UI
                                        design course</a>. Speaking as a former student at CareerFoundry, I can not only
                                    vouch for their UI Design Program’s quality and effectiveness in training me up and
                                    landing me a job—they offer a job guarantee in conjunction with the course—but also
                                    for the fact that the whole experience was thoroughly enjoyable.</p>

                                <p>One of my personal favorite examples of a gorgeous and functional UI can be found
                                    with Semplice Labs, a WordPress portfolio created by superstar designer Tobias Van
                                    Schneider, who’s designed for Spotify, BMW, Google and even NASA. Suffice to say he
                                    knows what he’s doing.</p>

                                    terms to find out more about Semplice. The rest of the website UI is actually an
                                    example of what users of the product can achieve with their own websites. Fluid
                                    animations and smooth transitions between pages make this interface memorable and
                                    desirable to users.</p>

                                <p>These are just a few of my favorite examples of good website UI design. Creating a
                                    usable, frictionless UI is an essential part of creating a positive connection with
                                    a user, not to mention making sure that it’s <a

                                        design</a>. When designing or evaluating an interface, it’s best to refer to the
                                    usability guidelines set forth by Nielsen in order to build a product that provides
                                    the best possible user experience.</p>
